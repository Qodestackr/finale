## Swift Transit UI.

This project proposes the development of a Transit System for Nairobi, Kenya, focusing on route planning and fare estimation functionalities to enhance the public transportation experience. The system aims to provide commuters with information on route options across the matatu network.

The project will utilize transit data, including routes, stops, and times between stops to enable users to plan their journeys in advance. By integrating this data into the system, users can access an interactive map, visualize optimal routes, and receive estimated fare ranges for their intended trips.

The system's user interface and experience will prioritize simplicity, intuitiveness, and accessibility. The system will offer a responsive and dynamic UI, ensuring an enjoyable user experience.
